# This is an example of the program after build
To run the program, run the .jar file.

Under the same directory, a foler 'data' will be created that stores the data of this program, do not delete unless you wish to clear the program data

*it's better to run the program in a dedicated directory for this matter*

There is also a development document under this directory, which is a reference document for a quick overview of the technologies used in the development of this program
